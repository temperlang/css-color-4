# Temper demos for CSS Color Module Level 4

See others/js/conversion.js for non-normative colorspace conversion code from
the css-color-4 spec. The separate unit tests were generated by AI, as were the
Temper versions of these files because being fixed manually. The others/csharp
code was also translated by AI.

The current demo of the Temper code can be run as follows:

```
temper build
cd examples/csharp/ColorPick
dotnet run
```

Then choose an image and click on pixels. The label at bottom shows the RGB
values at the clicked pixel, then the closest named color in RGB space then
OKLab space.
